A group of four men accosted a 29-year-old jogger near Sector 12\\u2019s boulevard around 10:50 PM, pulling him to the ground and punching him repeatedly before escaping in a waiting sedan. Witnesses described the attackers as wearing dark hoodies and carrying small backpacks. The victim, whose identity is protected, required hospitalization for a fractured rib and a concussion. Police responded within minutes, arriving at the scene with a medical unit and initiating a neighborhood canvass that included nearby apartment complexes, gyms, and vendors. CCTV from a nearby corner shop captured the sedan\\u2019s license plate, which helped investigators trace the vehicle to a family-owned transport service based in Karol Bagh. Forensic teams collected blood samples from the scene and obtained a piece of torn fabric that matched a hoodie in the suspects\\u2019 likely wardrobe. Local residents provided statements about a prior altercation at a nearby market earlier that evening, suggesting a possible personal motive linked to a dispute over borrowed money. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities interviewing potential witnesses and examining bank card transactions for purchases linked to the suspects. The victim\\u2019s family has requested privacy, and the community has rallied around him, organizing neighborhood watch groups to deter late-night street crime around Dwarka and nearby sectors. The incident underscores concerns about street safety near major transport hubs in northeast Delhi and has prompted police to increase nocturnal patrols in Dwarka\\u2019s Outer Ring Road corridor.\",\n          \"In 2016-05-12, a spree of vandalism hit Chandni Chowk during a busy afternoon. A group of youths vandalized several storefronts along the market stretch, breaking windowpanes and scrawling graffiti across shuttered iron grills. Police traced the perpetrators to a nearby cul-de-sac and detained three youths after a brief chase that ended near the Red Fort area. The suspects, who were in their late teens, admitted to the act, explaining it as a protest against rising taxes and municipal potholes. Early interviews suggested the vandalism caused significant property damage, with several shops reporting broken signage, shattered glass, and costs to repair. The authorities opened a preliminary inquiry, and shopkeepers organized a temporary joint vigil for added security. CCTV footage confirmed the pattern of destruction and identified a few other youths involved in a previous incident in the same market. Community leaders called for youth outreach programs and improved lighting along the Chandni Chowk corridor to deter such acts in the future.\",\n          \"On 2020-02-19, a high-profile robbery occurred in Saket\\u2019s market area, just after dusk, when a group of five entered a boutique under the pretext of inquiring about a product line. Within minutes, two masked individuals produced improvised weapons and forced staff to open a safe containing several luxury watches and jewelry. Customers were ushered toward the back of the store as a loud alarm sounded from a nearby jewelry counter. The suspects fled through a service alley that connects to a rear parking lot, where a getaway vehicle awaited. The police were alerted by a shop employee who managed to trigger the store\\u2019s silent alarm, and nearby security cameras captured the entire sequence. Witnesses reported seeing a white SUV speeding away toward the Outer Ring Road. The Delhi Police launched a comprehensive manhunt, reviewing CCTV footage from multiple angles in Saket, Lajpat Nagar, Munirka, and Greater Kailash. Forensic teams recovered a torn note left near the cash desk, suggesting a planned operation with possible connections to a broader network of criminals operating in South Delhi. Several victims opted for anonymity in police statements, while others described a chaotic scene with shattered glass and a few minor injuries from fleeing customers. Investigators are analyzing transaction records and checking credit card usage to identify any accomplices who may have fled the scene. The incident has spurred calls for tighter security at entrances to malls and market complexes in Saket and adjacent neighborhoods, with authorities promising to increase patrol presence during peak shopping hours.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"crime_severity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A group of four men accosted a 29-year-old jogger near Sector 12\\u2019s boulevard around 10:50 PM, pulling him to the ground and punching him repeatedly before escaping in a waiting sedan. Witnesses described the attackers as wearing dark hoodies and carrying small backpacks. The victim, whose identity is protected, required hospitalization for a fractured rib and a concussion. Police responded within minutes, arriving at the scene with a medical unit and initiating a neighborhood canvass that included nearby apartment complexes, gyms, and vendors. CCTV from a nearby corner shop captured the sedan\\u2019s license plate, which helped investigators trace the vehicle to a family-owned transport service based in Karol Bagh. Forensic teams collected blood samples from the scene and obtained a piece of torn fabric that matched a hoodie in the suspects\\u2019 likely wardrobe. Local residents provided statements about a prior altercation at a nearby market earlier that evening, suggesting a possible personal motive linked to a dispute over borrowed money. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities interviewing potential witnesses and examining bank card transactions for purchases linked to the suspects. The victim\\u2019s family has requested privacy, and the community has rallied around him, organizing neighborhood watch groups to deter late-night street crime around Dwarka and nearby sectors. The incident underscores concerns about street safety near major transport hubs in northeast Delhi and has prompted police to increase nocturnal patrols in Dwarka\\u2019s Outer Ring Road corridor.\",\n          \"In 2016-05-12, a spree of vandalism hit Chandni Chowk during a busy afternoon. A group of youths vandalized several storefronts along the market stretch, breaking windowpanes and scrawling graffiti across shuttered iron grills. Police traced the perpetrators to a nearby cul-de-sac and detained three youths after a brief chase that ended near the Red Fort area. The suspects, who were in their late teens, admitted to the act, explaining it as a protest against rising taxes and municipal potholes. Early interviews suggested the vandalism caused significant property damage, with several shops reporting broken signage, shattered glass, and costs to repair. The authorities opened a preliminary inquiry, and shopkeepers organized a temporary joint vigil for added security. CCTV footage confirmed the pattern of destruction and identified a few other youths involved in a previous incident in the same market. Community leaders called for youth outreach programs and improved lighting along the Chandni Chowk corridor to deter such acts in the future.\",\n          \"On 2020-02-19, a high-profile robbery occurred in Saket\\u2019s market area, just after dusk, when a group of five entered a boutique under the pretext of inquiring about a product line. Within minutes, two masked individuals produced improvised weapons and forced staff to open a safe containing several luxury watches and jewelry. Customers were ushered toward the back of the store as a loud alarm sounded from a nearby jewelry counter. The suspects fled through a service alley that connects to a rear parking lot, where a getaway vehicle awaited. The police were alerted by a shop employee who managed to trigger the store\\u2019s silent alarm, and nearby security cameras captured the entire sequence. Witnesses reported seeing a white SUV speeding away toward the Outer Ring Road. The Delhi Police launched a comprehensive manhunt, reviewing CCTV footage from multiple angles in Saket, Lajpat Nagar, Munirka, and Greater Kailash. Forensic teams recovered a torn note left near the cash desk, suggesting a planned operation with possible connections to a broader network of criminals operating in South Delhi. Several victims opted for anonymity in police statements, while others described a chaotic scene with shattered glass and a few minor injuries from fleeing customers. Investigators are analyzing transaction records and checking credit card usage to identify any accomplices who may have fled the scene. The incident has spurred calls for tighter security at entrances to malls and market complexes in Saket and adjacent neighborhoods, with authorities promising to increase patrol presence during peak shopping hours.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"crime_severity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"extracted_location\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dwarka, Delhi\",\n          \"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"extracted_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2017-11-03, 29-year-old, Sector 12\\u2019s\",\n          \"2016-05-12\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A group of four men accosted a 29-year-old jogger near Sector 12\\u2019s boulevard around 10:50 PM, pulling him to the ground and punching him repeatedly before escaping in a waiting sedan. Witnesses described the attackers as wearing dark hoodies and carrying small backpacks. The victim, whose identity is protected, required hospitalization for a fractured rib and a concussion. Police responded within minutes, arriving at the scene with a medical unit and initiating a neighborhood canvass that included nearby apartment complexes, gyms, and vendors. CCTV from a nearby corner shop captured the sedan\\u2019s license plate, which helped investigators trace the vehicle to a family-owned transport service based in Karol Bagh. Forensic teams collected blood samples from the scene and obtained a piece of torn fabric that matched a hoodie in the suspects\\u2019 likely wardrobe. Local residents provided statements about a prior altercation at a nearby market earlier that evening, suggesting a possible personal motive linked to a dispute over borrowed money. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities interviewing potential witnesses and examining bank card transactions for purchases linked to the suspects. The victim\\u2019s family has requested privacy, and the community has rallied around him, organizing neighborhood watch groups to deter late-night street crime around Dwarka and nearby sectors. The incident underscores concerns about street safety near major transport hubs in northeast Delhi and has prompted police to increase nocturnal patrols in Dwarka\\u2019s Outer Ring Road corridor.\",\n          \"In 2016-05-12, a spree of vandalism hit Chandni Chowk during a busy afternoon. A group of youths vandalized several storefronts along the market stretch, breaking windowpanes and scrawling graffiti across shuttered iron grills. Police traced the perpetrators to a nearby cul-de-sac and detained three youths after a brief chase that ended near the Red Fort area. The suspects, who were in their late teens, admitted to the act, explaining it as a protest against rising taxes and municipal potholes. Early interviews suggested the vandalism caused significant property damage, with several shops reporting broken signage, shattered glass, and costs to repair. The authorities opened a preliminary inquiry, and shopkeepers organized a temporary joint vigil for added security. CCTV footage confirmed the pattern of destruction and identified a few other youths involved in a previous incident in the same market. Community leaders called for youth outreach programs and improved lighting along the Chandni Chowk corridor to deter such acts in the future.\",\n          \"On 2020-02-19, a high-profile robbery occurred in Saket\\u2019s market area, just after dusk, when a group of five entered a boutique under the pretext of inquiring about a product line. Within minutes, two masked individuals produced improvised weapons and forced staff to open a safe containing several luxury watches and jewelry. Customers were ushered toward the back of the store as a loud alarm sounded from a nearby jewelry counter. The suspects fled through a service alley that connects to a rear parking lot, where a getaway vehicle awaited. The police were alerted by a shop employee who managed to trigger the store\\u2019s silent alarm, and nearby security cameras captured the entire sequence. Witnesses reported seeing a white SUV speeding away toward the Outer Ring Road. The Delhi Police launched a comprehensive manhunt, reviewing CCTV footage from multiple angles in Saket, Lajpat Nagar, Munirka, and Greater Kailash. Forensic teams recovered a torn note left near the cash desk, suggesting a planned operation with possible connections to a broader network of criminals operating in South Delhi. Several victims opted for anonymity in police statements, while others described a chaotic scene with shattered glass and a few minor injuries from fleeing customers. Investigators are analyzing transaction records and checking credit card usage to identify any accomplices who may have fled the scene. The incident has spurred calls for tighter security at entrances to malls and market complexes in Saket and adjacent neighborhoods, with authorities promising to increase patrol presence during peak shopping hours.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"crime_severity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
